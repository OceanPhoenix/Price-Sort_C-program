# Price-Sort_C-program
A C program that calculates the average, the high, and the low of the prices of a companyâ€™s stock over a specific period of time.
The program asks the user for the number of prices that will be entered and then dynamically allocates the correct amount of memory to be 
stored for each price.
The program passes the allocated memory into functions that calculate the average, high and low of the prices. 
The program de-allocates the memory before the program ends.
